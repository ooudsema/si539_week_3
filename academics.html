<p>I received a BA in History in April 2017 from the University of Michigan-Dearborn, with a focus on modern European history. I am currently pursuing a masterâ€™s degree in Information Sciences from the University of Michigan and am specializing in Archives and Records Management and Digital Curation.</p>  
    
<p>Coursework in the MSI program has provided me with a theoretical foundation in library and archival sciences (SI 580 Records & Archives, SI 667 Digital Curation, SI 678 Preserving Sound and Motion), technical and programming skills (SI 506 Programming I, SI 507 Intermediate Programming), and experience with qualitative research, usability evaluations and research methods (SI 501 Contextual Inquiry, SI 623 Research Methods for Information Professionals, SI 622 Usability Evaluation and Needs).  In Records & Archives and Digital Curation, I have studied the theoretical basis of archives and digital collections.  SI 678 allowed me to develop skills in audiovisual archiving and in working with obsolete mediums, with a project based on digitizing 45 records. Through the UMSI programming courses, I have learned programming using Python and SQL.  Finally, in Research Methods,  Usability Evaluation, and Contextual Inquiry courses I have worked with third-party participants to research a particular information-related problems and propose potential solutions.  </p>
